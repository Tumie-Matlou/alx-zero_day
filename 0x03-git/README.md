Ever since i created my first readme, i created a new directory called 0x01-git. In this directory, i created 3 new directories : bash, js and c In the c directory, i created a c_is_fun.c file In the js directory, i created the files main.js and index.js In the bash directory, i created a file called 'alx' and echoed the sentences: #!/bin/bash and ALX In the bash directory, i created another file called 'school' and echoed the sentences: #!/bin/bash and School I added all these changes to my 'master' branch and committed them, finally pushing them to Github. I created a new branch called 'update_script' In the update_script branch, I opened the bash directory and created a file called '98'. Moreover, in the bash directory, i updated the file contents in 'alx' by replacing 'ALX' with 'ALX School' using vi editor. still in the bash directory, i updated the file contents in 'school' by replacing 'School' with 'The school is open" I went on to add these changes, commit them and push them to the master branch using the command ' git push -u origin update_script' I wen on to checkout to the master branch. In the master branch, i updated the file contents in 'alx' by replacing 'ALX' with 'ALX School is so cool' using vi editor. i added the changes, commited them and pushed them to origin.
