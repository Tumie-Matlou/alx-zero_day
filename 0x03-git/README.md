# Git directory

Ever since I created my first readme, I created a new directory called 0x01-git. <br>
In this directory, I created 3 new directories : bash, js and c. <br> 
In the c directory, I created a c_is_fun.c file. <br>
In the js directory, I created the files main.js and index.js. <br>
In the bash directory, I created a file called 'alx' and echoed the sentences: '#!/bin/bash' and 'ALX'. <br>
In the bash directory, I created another file called 'school' and echoed the sentences: '#!/bin/bash' and 'School'. <br>
I added all these changes to my 'master' branch and committed them, finally pushing them to Github. <br>
I created a new branch called 'update_script'. <br>
In the update_script branch, I opened the bash directory and created a file called '98'. <br>
Moreover, in the bash directory, I updated the file contents in 'alx' by replacing 'ALX' with 'ALX School' using vi editor.<br>
Still in the bash directory, I updated the file contents in school file by replacing 'School' with 'The school is open". <br>
I went on to add these changes, commit them and push them to the master branch using the command 'git push -u origin update_script'. <br>
I went on to checkout to the master branch. <br> 
In the master branch, I updated the file contents in alx file by replacing 'ALX' with 'ALX School is so cool' using vi editor. <br>
I added the changes, commited them and pushed them to origin.
